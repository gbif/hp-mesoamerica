The <b>Data Science Network for the Conservation of Mesoamerican Biodiversity (redbioma)</b> aims to create a dynamic connection between individuals and institutions to encourage Skill development and research in biodiversity conservation. Achieving these goals requires the support and engagement of all its members.

<br>
<br>

We encourage you to become an active member, not only by contributing data to platforms like <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/">iNaturalist</a>, <a href="https://ebird.org/home">eBird</a>, or the Global Biodiversity Information Facility <a href="https://www.gbif.org/">(GBIF)</a> and other regional or global databases, but also by sharing your opinions on how to apply data science to biodiversity conservation in the region; how to involve more colleagues and friends in these platforms and collaborative networks, especially women and young people; by developing and implementing IT solutions for biodiversity data; driving research on biodiversity conservation topics; supporting species identification on iNaturalist for other participant's observations; and contributing in other crucial areas to support the development of science, education, and biodiversity conservation in the Mesoamerican region.
