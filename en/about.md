# About us

<div style="text-align: justify">
The network's goal is to propose solutions to conservation problems through data science, with a strong focus on capacity building and empowering women in the region.
<br><br>
This project will strengthen partnerships among institutions in the Mesoamerican region, identify some of the participants' needs related to the sustainable use and conservation of biodiversity, implement an open data portal that integrates data and information on biodiversity, and enhance capacities in data science to support the development of science, education, and biodiversity conservation, prioritizing the most vulnerable groups in the Mesoamerican population.

## General
<div style="text-align: justify">
To establish a Mesoamerican network of biodiversity observers and researchers to propose solutions to conservation problems through data science, with a strong focus on capacity building and empowering women in the region.

# Collaborators

## National Commission for the Knowledge and Use of Biodiversity (CONABIO)

<div style="text-align: justify">
    <a href="https://www.gob.mx/conabio">CONABIO</a>'s mission is to promote, coordinate, support, and carry out activities aimed at understanding biological diversity, as well as its conservation and sustainable use for the benefit of society. It was conceived as an applied research organization that promotes basic research, compiles and generates information on biodiversity, develops human capacities in biodiversity informatics, and serves as a public source of accessible information and knowledge for society at large.

## National Commission for Biodiversity Management (CONAGEBIO)
<div style="text-align: justify">
    <a href="https://www.conagebio.go.cr/">CONAGEBIO</a> is a maximum deconcentration body of Costa Rica's Ministry of Environment and Energy (MINAE), created under Biodiversity Law No. 7788. Costa Rica, being one of the world's most biologically rich countries, tasked CONAGEBIO with articulating the comprehensive management of biodiversity to contribute to its conservation and sustainable use, promoting societal participation and the fair and equitable distribution of derived benefits. During the construction of the “Second National Biodiversity Strategy 2016-2025,” the need was identified for an integral mechanism enabling the state to access reliable biodiversity information, integrating it into national policy and development planning.
    <br><br>
    Therefore, in 2017, CONAGEBIO began designing the Information Platform for Knowledge and Information Management on Costa Rica’s Biodiversity (PGCIB), later renamed <a href="http://biodiversidad.go.cr/">BIODATACR.</a> BIODATACR's primary function is to provide free and open access to data and information about Costa Rica’s biodiversity through IT that integrates and visualizes this information to support the development of science, education, and biodiversity conservation. Moreover, the government of Costa Rica decided to establish the Inter-Institutional Commission for Knowledge and Information Management on Biodiversity (CIGECIB), responsible for recommending strategies and actions necessary for BIODATACR's development and consolidation and managing technical and financial support. This commission operates ad honorem, coordinated by CONAGEBIO. Currently, it includes representatives from CONAGEBIO, CENIGA, SINAC, MNCR, MICITT, and CONARE. These measures were implemented under Executive Decree 40725-MINAE, which established CIGECIB and declared BIODATACR a matter of public interest to ensure its permanence and legal foundation over time.

## National Council of Protected Areas (CONAP) 
<div style="text-align: justify">
    Through the GBIF Guatemala Node, the National Biodiversity Information System "SNIBgt," the mission of the <a href="https://conap.gob.gt/">CONAP</a> is to promote and support the conservation of protected areas and biological diversity by planning, coordinating, and implementing the necessary conservation policies and models, working jointly with other actors, and contributing to sustainable national development.

## School of Computer Engineering, Costa Rica Institute of Technology (ITCR)
<div style="text-align: justify">
    The Costa Rica Institute of Technology <a href="https://www.tec.ac.cr/">(TEC)</a> is an autonomous Costa Rican institution of higher education dedicated to teaching, research, and technology extension and related sciences for the country's development. The institution was created to contribute to the country's integral development by training human resources, conducting research, and offering outreach programs; maintaining scientific, technological, and technical leadership; upholding academic excellence and strict adherence to ethical, humanistic, and environmental norms, from a perspective of state university quality and competitiveness both nationally and internationally.
    <br><br>
    The ITCR School of Computer Engineering’s mission is to contribute to Costa Rican society by generating scientific and technological knowledge in computing through teaching, research, outreach, and external engagement, based on principles of academic excellence, social relevance, regionalization, equity, and comprehensive education.

## Entomological Museum of León, Nicaragua
<div style="text-align: justify">
    The <a href="http://bio-nica.info/topic/index.html">Entomological Museum of León</a> holds the largest entomological collection in Nicaragua. Its director serves as Editor of the Nicaraguan Entomology Journal (founded in 1987) and the Nicaraguan Biodiversity Journal (founded in 2015), both aimed at disseminating works conducted in Nicaragua and neighboring countries.
